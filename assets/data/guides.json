    "overview": "The factory headlight wiring routes all the current through the turn signal switch in the steering column. That causes voltage drop — dim lights — and eventually burns the switch contacts. A relay harness bypasses all that and sends power straight from the battery to the bulbs. The switch just triggers the relay instead of carrying the load. The difference in brightness is noticeable and the switch lasts a lot longer.",
