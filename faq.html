      <p>Answers to common questions about MyOldCherokee.com and how the directory works.</p>
    </div>

    <details class="faq-item" open>
      <summary>What is MyOldCherokee.com?</summary>
      <p>MyOldCherokee.com is an independent buy and sell directory and resource hub for owners of older Cherokee models, with repair shop listings, junk/salvage yard listings, DIY/troubleshooting Guides, and community resources.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does MyOldCherokee.com verify listings or sellers?</summary>
      <p>No. While listings and information are submitted in good faith and are believed to be accurate to the best of our knowledge, MyOldCherokee.com does not independently inspect or verify third-party listings, businesses, products, or services. Users are responsible for their own due diligence.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I report a suspicious or inaccurate listing?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Please do! We are building on a solid community that we are actually a part of so we want to give the same we hope for which is the very best. Users can flag listings for review. We will review and may remove listings at our discretion. Reporting, while it does not constitute verification or endorsement, it can help to improve the directory quality.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does inclusion in the directory mean endorsement?</summary>
      <p>No. Inclusion in the directory does not mean endorsement, certification, or approval by MyOldCherokee.com.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do I find a shop's phone number, address, or website from the directory?</summary>
      <p>We provide as much information as we are given by the person who submits it. Where available, we will also link directly to a business's own website as the first choice. If no website is listed, we link to a Google Maps location or Google search result so you can find directions, hours, and contact info. If neither is available, we link to a Yelp listing as a fallback. The goal is always to get you to a place where you can reach the business directly.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What are Guides?</summary>
      <p>Guides are owner-focused DIY and troubleshooting resources for older Cherokee models. They are provided in good faith and are accurate to the best of our knowledge, though they do not replace professional inspection or repair advice. Results may vary by vehicle, model year, and condition.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Are junk/salvage yard listings verified?</summary>
      <p>Salvage yard listings are submitted in good faith and are believed to be accurate to the best of our knowledge. MyOldCherokee.com does not independently verify inventory. Always confirm inventory, fitment, pricing, and policies directly with the yard.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is MyOldCherokee.com affiliated with Jeep or Stellantis?</summary>
      <p>No. MyOldCherokee.com is an independent website and is not affiliated with, sponsored by, authorized by, or endorsed by Stellantis N.V., FCA US LLC, or any of their subsidiaries, divisions, or brands. Jeep&reg; is a registered trademark of FCA US LLC. Cherokee&reg;, Grand Cherokee&reg;, Wrangler&reg;, and all other Jeep&reg; model names are registered trademarks of FCA US LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stellantis N.V. All trademark and brand references on this site are used solely for vehicle identification and parts compatibility purposes and do not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by the trademark holders. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What Cherokee models are covered?</summary>
      <p>MyOldCherokee.com focuses on older Cherokee models still on the road — or one good weekend away from it. The directory covers vehicles, parts, shops, and guides relevant to these models.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do I list a vehicle, parts, shop, or salvage yard?</summary>
      <p>Use the <a href="submit.html" style="color:var(--red);text-decoration:underline;">Submit Listing</a> page to submit your listing for inclusion in the directory. We review submissions and may reach out if we need additional information.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do I get a listing updated or removed?</summary>
      <p>Use the <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--red);text-decoration:underline;">Contact page</a> and provide the listing name, the change needed, and your contact email. We will update or remove listings at our discretion.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I submit a guide or resource link?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Use the <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--red);text-decoration:underline;">Contact page</a> to suggest a resource, guide link, or original how-to content. All submitted content is reviewed and published in good faith.</p>

<!-- FEATURED BUSINESSES FAQ -->
<section class="section" id="featured-faq" style="background:#f8f5f0;border-top:3px solid var(--red);">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:820px;">
    <div class="section-head left">
      <div class="section-label">Featured Businesses</div>
      <h2>Getting Featured on MyOldCherokee.com</h2>
      <p>Questions about featured placement, pricing, and what's included.</p>
    </div>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does it mean to be a featured business?</summary>
      <p>Featured businesses are shops, suppliers, salvage yards, and fabricators that support the site and pay for elevated placement. Featured listings appear at the top of relevant pages and display an expanded card with your logo or initials, description, service area, phone number, map link, tags, and a verified badge. It's the best way to get found by Cherokee owners who are actively looking for a shop or parts source.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What are the pricing levels?</summary>
      <p>There are two levels of featured placement:</p>
      <ul style="margin:0.5rem 0 0 1.25rem;line-height:1.8;">
        <li><strong>Level 1 — $39/month:</strong> Featured Businesses page, top of matching State page, top of matching Category page. Full business card with all fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Level 2 — $50/month:</strong> Everything in Level 1, plus Homepage carousel placement and Featured Vendor callout in blog posts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">Both plans are month-to-month. Cancel anytime.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What's the difference between a free listing and a featured listing?</summary>
      <p>Free listings show your business name, city/state, and category with a basic link. Featured listings show a full card: logo or initials, description, service area with ZIP, tags, tap-to-call phone number, website link, Google Maps link, and a "Submitter verified" badge. Featured listings also appear at the top of relevant pages, above the free listings.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How does the homepage carousel work?</summary>
      <p>The homepage carousel (Level 2 only) puts your business card in a rotating section below the hero on the homepage. It's the first thing visitors see when they scroll past the search bar. Desktop users see 2–3 cards at a time with left/right controls. Mobile users can swipe horizontally.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does "Submitter verified" mean?</summary>
      <p>The "Submitter verified" badge means the person who submitted the listing confirmed the location, phone number, and hours were accurate at the time of submission. It does not mean MyOldCherokee.com independently inspected or certified the business. We always recommend calling ahead before visiting.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do I get started as a featured business?</summary>
      <p>Use the <a href="featured.html#get-featured" style="color:var(--red);text-decoration:underline;">Get Featured</a> page to choose your level and start the process. Or <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--red);text-decoration:underline;">contact us</a> directly with questions. We'll get your listing set up and live quickly.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I cancel or change my featured listing?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Featured placement is month-to-month with no long-term commitment. You can cancel anytime or switch levels by <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--red);text-decoration:underline;">contacting us</a>. Changes typically take effect within one business day.</p>
