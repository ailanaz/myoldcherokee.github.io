      <p>If you've parked your XJ in a busy lot and come back to find a small rubber duck sitting on your door handle or hood, you've been ducked. Welcome to Duck Duck Jeep — one of the stranger, friendlier things the off-road community has produced in the last few years.</p>

      <h2>Where It Started</h2>
      <p>The tradition started in Ontario, Canada in 2020. A woman named Allison Parliament put a rubber duck on another Jeep while waiting in a parking lot — just to make someone's day a little better during a difficult year. She shared the story on social media, and it spread fast. Within months, Jeep owners across North America and eventually worldwide were buying bags of rubber ducks to leave on each other's vehicles.</p>

      <p>The idea is simple: find a Jeep (or Cherokee, or Wrangler, or any vehicle in the family), leave a duck somewhere visible, and move on. No note required, though many owners leave a small card explaining the tradition. No transaction, no expectation of anything in return. Just a small, unexpected gesture between strangers who happen to drive similar vehicles.</p>

      <h2>XJs in the Mix</h2>
      <p>XJ owners participate just as much as anyone else. The XJ is recognizable enough — especially a well-used one with a lift and mud flaps — that other Jeep enthusiasts know exactly what they're looking at. Getting ducked on an older Cherokee feels different than getting ducked on a brand-new Wrangler. There's an implied acknowledgment: <em>nice XJ, I see you.</em></p>

      <p>Some XJ owners go full send on it. They keep a bag of ducks in the center console or glove box, specifically to leave on other Jeeps they see when they're out. Others have themed ducks — construction ducks, cowboy ducks, patriotic ducks — and treat it like a small collection. A few have turned it into a ritual, leaving a duck every time they see a ratty old XJ that someone clearly loves.</p>

      <h2>What to Do If You Get Ducked</h2>
      <p>You keep it. That's basically the only rule. Some owners display their ducks on the dash or in the cabin as a running tally of encounters. Others start their own collection to pass forward. The culture encourages passing it on — if you get ducked, the next time you see a Jeep somewhere, you leave a duck.</p>

      <p>Some people add a small tag with the hashtag <strong>#DuckDuckJeep</strong> and their Instagram handle, so if the recipient posts about it, there's a connection back. It's become a surprisingly effective way to meet other local Jeep people.</p>

      <h2>Where to Get Ducks</h2>
      <p>Rubber ducks are cheap and everywhere. Dollar stores, party supply shops, and online retailers all carry them. The more creative duck options — foam animals, character ducks, holiday-themed ducks — are available in bulk from party supply wholesalers and Amazon. A bag of 50 plain rubber ducks runs a few dollars and will last you a long time unless you're particularly aggressive about ducking strangers.</p>

      <h2>It's a Small Thing</h2>
      <p>Duck Duck Jeep doesn't fix anything. It doesn't make your XJ run better or find you parts. But it's a reminder that the Jeep community — old Cherokees included — is a real community, not just a shared consumer interest. People recognize each other on the road, in parking lots, on trails. They wave. They stop to help. They leave rubber ducks.</p>

      <p>If you haven't been ducked yet, keep your eyes on your door handles. And maybe keep a few ducks in your console for when the opportunity comes around.</p>
