      <p>The XJ Cherokee ran from 1984 to 2001, seventeen years, one generation, no major ground-up redesign. That almost never happens in the auto industry. And when it ended, the XJ didn't fade. It just got more popular among a certain kind of driver who cares more about capability and honesty than comfort and convenience features.</p>

      <p>If you own one, you already know why you do. If you're considering one, here's what keeps pulling people in.</p>

      <h2>It Was Engineered to Last</h2>
      <p>The XJ's unibody construction was unusual for an off-road vehicle at the time. Most competitors used body-on-frame designs. Chrysler bet on a stiffer, lighter platform, and won. The result was a vehicle that handled better on-road and held its shape better over time than many of its contemporaries. Rust aside (we'll get to that), XJ bodies are remarkably solid even with high mileage.</p>

      <p>The 4.0L inline-six that powered most XJs from 1991 onward is legendary in its own right. Simple, torquey, and essentially bulletproof if maintained. These engines routinely hit 250,000 miles. Some go much further. Rebuilds are affordable and well-documented because so many have been done.</p>

      <h2>Parts Are Still Everywhere</h2>
      <p>More than two decades after production ended, XJ parts are not hard to find. Salvage yards across the country still have them stacked and inventoried. The aftermarket for suspension, bumpers, skid plates, and axle components has never been larger. Because the XJ shared components with several other Chrysler vehicles, even basic hardware store trips can resolve issues that would strand you with a modern vehicle.</p>

      <p>This is a major reason XJs remain popular with people who like to wrench their own vehicles. Nothing about maintaining one requires special tools or proprietary software. You can do most jobs with a socket set, a repair manual, and an afternoon.</p>

      <h2>The Size Is Right</h2>
      <p>Full-size trucks and SUVs have gotten enormous. The XJ is compact by comparison, just over 165 inches long in two-door trim, 167 in four-door. It fits in a normal parking space, fits in a normal garage, fits on a trail without needing to widen every obstacle. People who use these for real off-road work, not just lifestyle display, appreciate that you don't need a spotter to park at the grocery store.</p>

      <p>That same compactness makes XJs surprisingly capable off-road. Short overhangs, good approach and departure angles, and the Dana 30 front / Dana 35 or Dana 44 rear axle setup give you a capable platform that responds well to even modest modifications.</p>

      <h2>The Community</h2>
      <p>There are XJ forums that have been running since the late 1990s. There are dedicated Facebook groups, YouTube channels, regional clubs, and organized trail runs for XJ owners specifically. The community is unusually active for a vehicle that stopped production in 2001.</p>

      <p>Part of this is the shared experience of ownership, finding solutions to common problems, sharing sourcing tips, helping new owners avoid the mistakes everyone else already made. Part of it is just that XJ people tend to use their vehicles, not just photograph them. That creates a different kind of community.</p>

      <h2>It's Honest</h2>
      <p>There's nothing pretend about an XJ. No active suspension modes, no terrain selectors, no 14-speaker sound system with haptic feedback. You turn the dial to 4WD, you go. You pick up a wrench, you fix it. The vehicle does what it does without intermediary technology obscuring the experience.</p>

      <p>For a lot of owners, that's exactly the point. In a world of increasingly complex vehicles that require dealer diagnostics for basic maintenance, the XJ represents something that's become genuinely rare: a capable 4x4 that a competent owner can fully understand and keep running indefinitely.</p>

      <p>That's why it's still loved. Not because of nostalgia. Because it still works.</p>
